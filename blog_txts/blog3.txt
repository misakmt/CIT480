Setting up a Samba Share might be a little more straight forward for most users, although it still has some configuring to do, in order for it to properly work. In order to make my VPN a bit more useful, I decided to use it to use it as a network location. Since my Raspberry Pi only has 32gb of storage (via the sd card it boots off of), I decided to attach it to an external hard drive. Configuring that will be explained later in the blog.

At this point, your Pi should already have a static internal IP and have SSH enabled.
To proceed with the samba set up:
	• sudo su
	• apt-get update
	• apt-get upgrade
	• apt-get install samba samba-common-bin

1) Now we would need to edit the configuration file so it supports our setup and needs.
	• cd /etc/samba
	• File is located in this path as smb.conf

2) We can make a copy of this file and save it as a backup:
	• cp smb.conf smb.conf.backup
	• vi/vim/nano smb.conf & edit away

3) There are many ways to set up Samba, but I will state the most common / most useful:
	• Creating a directory somewhere on the machine to be shared
		-ex: /SharedFiles
	• Access to own home directory
	• Access to a directory which is technically a mounted location (External Drive)

4) To make a share folder:
	• Specify a name in brackets
		-ex: [MyShare]
	• Return, space/tab and state requirements
		path = /directory
		browsable = yes
		writable = yes
		guest ok = no
		read only = no
		create mask = 0755
		directory mask = 0755

	• The same setting applies for an external drive, however you would have to make sure
		that the drive is mounted and accessible:
		-ex: /mnt/volume1

5) The most simple and common way is to make home directories accessible:
	• This is useful because it can be accessed by multiple unique users on the machine
	• If settings are done correctly, no one but that user can access their home directory
	• This setting can be found under the [homes] section
		-ex:    comment = Home directories
			read only = no
			browsable = no

6) Lastly, you would need to add users and a password to use Samba. Samba uses the same users which can be found on the unix machine, it just has to be configured to smb as well.
	• sudo smbpasswd -a PiUser
	• set password

7) Restart Samba
	• sudo /etc/init.d/samba restart
	or
	• sudo systemctl restart smbd.service

8) Now preferably using a different machine on the same network, try connecting to share:
	•smb://192.168.x.x/PiUser
	•smb://192.168.x.x/MyShare
	•smb://192.168.x.x/Volume1

	- When prompted, enter Username and Password for that user account
	
	* For this step, you may also use your hostname to access machine instead of IP Address 

9) Now you may share files between unix, Mac, and Windows machines

10) You may also do this from anywhere as long as you VPN into your network before trying step 8
