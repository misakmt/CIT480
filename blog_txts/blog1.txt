The AWS lecture and EC2 labs were both very informative. I can already tell this is an environment I am interested learning more about, and maybe even pursuing a career in.
Despite having experience conducting the same end goal on a local machine, the only issue I happen to run into is the change in terminology and user interface. Perhaps for all users new to AWS, the terminology and steps in achieving certain steps will be the biggest learning curve. I suppose, after getting accustomed to the wording and tools within AWS, everything will be more straight-forward.

What I liked most about the EC2 creation process was the fact that security groups can be made early on and reused for future instances. AWS really made it easy for users to go ahead and open ports and manage availability early on. Despite being able to change firewall settings within instances, security groups serve as a virtual (physical) firewall beforehand.

One thing that was a bit confusing for me were the use of Elastic IP Addresses. The lab briefly explained the reasoning behind EIPs, but it was not that clear. From my understanding, since EIPs are associated to your account and not the specific instance, users may associate the EIP to another instance to cover up for a failure.

Overall, I enjoyed learning about the basic introductions to spinning up EC2 servers in AWS. The simplicity and quickness of having a web server ready to go is incredible. It is no surprise that so many enterprise environments are moving towards cloud infrastructure via AWS. As a matter of fact, AWS has grown so much over the years, in 2019, Amazon reported 35 billion dollars in revenue just from AWS. They brought in more revenue within 1 quarter than their biggest competitor, Google Cloud did in all of 2019.
