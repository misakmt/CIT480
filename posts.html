	    <h1>Lab A | Setting Up Your Environment</h1>
			<h3> Misak Tivriktsyan, 8/30/19 </h3>

				The lab introduction and objectives are well thought out and informative. It is a good summary of what shells are and how ssh will be used throughout the course.
				During the installations of SSH (for non-unix users) it might be useful to explain why additional steps are required for windows or what the other possibilities are such as; MobaXterm or PuTTY. <br> <br>
				At this point I would believe that students who are new to computer science and information technology have little to no knowledge about containers and VMs. It would be useful to briefly inform them about the differences between the two and why containers are preferred in some production environments. <br> <br>
				During the build and creation of the container, there is only one bullet point for why the mnt option is used. It's crucial to know that it would have worked perfectly fine without the mnt, but it would not update with laptop and vice versa. <br> <br>
				It would be helpful to explain what the command "scp" is actually doing. 'scp' can be used in a few different ways, but sticking to the syntax given in the instructions, it is important to know that the first part is using students' credentials to log into the sandbox server using ssh -- The second part will specify our professor's path to dockerfile, transfer over to our machine, and lastly exit out of ssh.<br> <br>
				While creating a user account and home directory on the container, students should know why they are running chown --> what is the point of it and how does it differ from chmod. Also, what happens to root user afterwards? <br> <br>
				There is no explanation on why or how configuring accounts/directories on the cit160 container and sandbox server occur. For example, how we transfer and set up 'profile', which is a script used by professor Fitzgerald in order to produce the reports. I myself was confused on the automation and set up until I realized 'class_setup' is a function put together in the bash script to use the scp command.
				Some students may be confused on what is a linux command as opposed to what is possible due to the bash script.
